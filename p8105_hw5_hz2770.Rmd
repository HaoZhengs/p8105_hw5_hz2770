```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# read the csv
homicide_data = read.csv("./data/homicide_data.csv")
```

## Problem 1
The dataset contains 52179 homicide cases and 12 variables including the date, victim's demographic information, city, state, precise longitude and latitude, and disposition status.

Then we create a new variable called `city_state`, and show the number of all homicides and unsolved homicides in each `city_state`.
```{r}
homicide_data = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  unite("city_state", city, state, sep = ", ")

homicide_data %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"))
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
